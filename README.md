# icade-8bitty-python-win
A Python 3.9.0 code to create a virtual Xbox 360 controller on Windows to use the iCad 8-Bitty as a game controller.


You will need to install Python (tested on 3.9.0) to execute the code. You also need to install vgamepad and keyboard in the Terminal with those 2 commands:

pip install vgamepad<br>
pip install keyboard



To test that it's working properly, open the Game Controllers window by pressing WIN + R to open the Run window, then type in joy.cpl.

You should see in the list "Controller (XBOX 360 For Windows)".
